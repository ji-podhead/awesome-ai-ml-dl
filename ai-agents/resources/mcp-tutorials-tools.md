# MCP Frameworks, Tutorials, and Tools for AI Agent Development

This document provides a curated list of Model-Control-Presenter (MCP) frameworks, tutorials, and tools that are relevant to the development of AI agents.

## MCP Frameworks

*   **[Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: A comprehensive framework for developing applications powered by language models. It provides modular components for working with LLMs, including models, prompts, memory, indexes, chains, and agents, which align well with MCP concepts.
*   **[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/)**: A framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. CrewAI enables agents to collaborate to solve complex tasks, fitting an advanced MCP paradigm where multiple controller/presenter layers interact.
*   **[Microsoft Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/)**: A framework for enabling next-generation LLM applications with multi-agent conversations. Autogen allows developers to build complex workflows with multiple agents that can converse with each other and humans, embodying a distributed MCP architecture.
*   **[Uagents](https://fetch.ai/docs/uea/framework/uagents/)**: A framework by Fetch.ai for building decentralized autonomous agents. It allows for the creation of agents that can perform tasks, communicate, and transact in a decentralized network.

## Tutorials

*   **[Langchain Quickstart](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/quickstart)**: The official quickstart guide for Langchain, providing a hands-on introduction to its core concepts and how to build your first LLM application.
*   **[CrewAI Quickstart](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart/)**: Official CrewAI documentation to quickly get started building multi-agent collaborative systems.
*   **[Microsoft Autogen Examples](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Examples/AutoGen-Agent)**: A collection of examples showcasing how to use Autogen for various multi-agent scenarios.
*   **[Build Your First AI Agent with Uagents](https://fetch.ai/docs/uea/guides/general/intro-to-uagent-course/build-your-first-uagent/)**: A step-by-step guide to creating your first agent using the Fetch.ai Uagents framework.
*   **[Introduction to Agents with Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/tutorials/23_introducing_agents)**: A tutorial by deepset Haystack on how to build and use agents for question answering and task execution.
*   **[Creating a Simple AI Agent with LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/simple_proxy#example-usage-1)**: While LiteLLM is primarily for model abstraction, its documentation often includes examples that can be adapted for simple agentic control flows. This specific link shows basic proxy usage which is a step towards agent tool calling.

## Tools

*   **[LiteLLM](https://litellm.ai/)**: Provides a unified interface to interact with various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Cohere, Anthropic, etc.). Essential for the "Model" component in an MCP architecture, allowing flexibility.
*   **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**: Allows running large language models (LLMs) locally. Useful for developing and testing agents with local models, ensuring privacy and reducing costs.
*   **[LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith)**: A platform by Langchain for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications. Crucial for understanding and improving agent behavior (the "Controller" and "Presenter" logic).
*   **[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)**: A Python library for data validation and settings management using Python type hints. Extremely useful for defining schemas for tool inputs/outputs and agent configurations.
*   **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. Often used to expose agent capabilities as services (part of the "View" or "Presenter").
*   **[Chainlit](https://chainlit.io/)**: An open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build and share AI user interfaces. It can serve as the "View" component in an MCP setup for conversational agents.
*   **[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)**: A Python library that allows you to quickly create customizable UI components for your machine learning models, demos, and web applications. Useful for creating interactive "Views" for agents.
*   **[Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma)](https://www.pinecone.io/)**: Tools for storing and searching vector embeddings, which are critical for agents that need to retrieve information from large knowledge bases (part of the "Model" or supporting the "Controller").
*   **[Google AI Studio (Vertex AI)](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/ai-studio/overview)**: Provides tools and models (like Gemini) for building generative AI applications. Can be the core "Model" and provide infrastructure for agent deployment.
*   **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)**: Direct access to OpenAI models like GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, which are often the "Model" component in many AI agents.
*   **[Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index)**: Provides thousands of pre-trained models and tools to access them. Excellent for sourcing open-source models for the "Model" part of an agent.
*   **[Flowise AI](https://flowiseai.com/)**: A low-code/no-code tool for building LLM applications, including agents, using a visual interface. Can help in rapidly prototyping agentic workflows.
*   **[Embedchain](https://embedchain.ai/)**: A framework that simplifies the creation of LLM-powered bots over any dataset. It handles loading, chunking, embedding, and storing data for easy retrieval by agents.

This list is not exhaustive but provides a good starting point for developers looking to build AI agents using MCP principles.
The field is rapidly evolving, so it's recommended to also follow communities and publications in the AI space for the latest developments.
